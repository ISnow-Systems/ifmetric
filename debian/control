Description: Set routing metrics for a network interface
 ifmetric is a Linux tool for setting the metrics of all IPv4 routes
 attached to a given network interface at once.  This may be used to
 change the priority of routing IPv4 traffic over the interface.
 Lower metrics correlate with higher priorities.
